fRUSTtration
By Hascion

In all my years of tertiary education,
I have faced many bouts of indoctrination.
From a brilliant mind — some would say a prodigy —
Sharing to others his corrosive ideology.

Their passion was unlike anything I'd ever seen;
Their works of art displayed on a computer screen.
The tools they used, the peak of efficiency;
With every keystroke, they displayed their proficiency.

Their language of choice, none other than Rust,
The concepts it taught were frequently discussed.
Not a day goes by without giving it a mention,
Because of which I showed a playful frustration.

Despite this, through it, I've learned many lessons,
Obtained frequent answers to almost all of my questions.
From good coding practices to the concept of ownership,
Like a video advertisement you'd be hard pressed to skip.

To overlook this language would be a modern day crime,
Its improvements to performance are just too sublime.
And if you're looking to learn this language with ease,
Feel free to ask our mutual friend for his expertise.
